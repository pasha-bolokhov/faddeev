<h2>About (from wikipedia)</h2>
<p>Ludvig Dmitrievich Faddeev is a Soviet and Russian theoretical
physicist and mathematician. He is famous for the discovery of the Faddeev
equations in the theory of the quantum mechanical three-body problem and for
the development of path integral methods in the quantization of non-abelian
gauge field theories, including the introduction (with Victor Popov) of
Faddeev-Popov ghosts. He led the Leningrad School, in which he along with many
of his students developed the quantum inverse scattering method for studying
quantum integrable systems in one space and one time dimension. This work led
to the invention of quantum groups </p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Ludvig Faddeev was born in Leningrad in a family of mathematicians. His father,
Dmitry Faddeev, was a well known algebraist, professor of Leningrad University
and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. His mother was known for her
work in numerical linear algebra. Faddeev attended Leningrad University,
receiving his undergraduate degree in 1956. He enrolled in physics, rather
than mathematics, "to be independent of [his] father". Nevertheless, he
received a solid education in mathematics as well "due to the influence of V.
A. Fock and V. I. Smirnov". His doctoral work, on scattering theory, was
completed in 1959 under the direction of Olga Ladyzhenskaya.
From 1976 to 2000, Faddeev was head of the St. Petersburg Department of
Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences (PDMI RAS).
In 1988 he founded the Euler International Mathematical Institute, now
a department of PDMI RAS</p>
